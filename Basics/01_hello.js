console.log("Hello world");

console.log("hello this is sumit patel and i just start learning javascript basic")

//in javascript ";" semicolon are not mandatory, semicolon are usually use to break the line but in js if we write the code in new line it will treat  differently 

/* console.log("hello") console.log("this is sumit")
this is wrong way to write in here the compiler give us error bcoz there is two console.log in one line 


 console.log("hello"); console.log("this is sumit")
 this is correct bcoz we add semicolon between them so now the line is break between these console now they will treat differently 

 but again never write code like this because as a coder we have to code which is readable and less confusing

var password= 123832 //never use var beacuse var dont knwo what is block scope. scope means "{------}" the value which are written inside these curly brackets 
//var doesnâ€™t respect block scope (i.e., if, for, while blocks) and functional scope, which could lead to confusing code and unintended side effects

city="ghaziabad" // in here city is the global variable... but prefer not to write like this. It's a good practice to explicitly declare variables using const and let.
